				<p class="faq_s_title">Mechmania</p>
				<p>The 21st annual Military Electronic Combat Hardware Training Competition (Mechmania) is fast approaching! The competition ranks cyberwarriors by pitting them against each other in a simulated cyber-warfare environment. However, there is one major catch – since the United Nations Network Security Agency (UN-NSA) deems it too dangerous for human cyberwarriors to participate, they have instructed you to build a computer program to do so instead!</p>
